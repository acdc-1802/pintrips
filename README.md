## PINTRIPS ##

# Milestones

User Trip Planning Phase:

I. Render a map that you can pin with places you want to go to (travel dream board) 
Yarn, weaving experience places, snapshots, memorable 
Dreamcatcher 
Tapestry of voyage

  "Open a new board" which is  a map
  Board is based on location, yarn visualizes the time between experiences on the board

  Create multiple boards and can go into a dream board
  User can pick themes with a set color scheme (constellation map? modern print map? historical map?)
  User create's their own categories

II. Be able to place pins on what you want to do

III. Share this map with friends that can invite to edit so that pin can be added in real-time ****
could each user have their own theme even though they're working on the same map board


User Actual Trip Phase:

IV. During the trip app need to be opened to track location.
If user/users get to a pre-determined pin spot pin can be "fullfilled"  "You fulfilled your dream pin!"
A yarn line is started at the first pin fill (which is the timeline) A date stamp is started
As more pins are fulfilled, yarn is a visualization of where you were from pin to pin
Ends when user closes the board.
They have options to clear the empty (unfulfilled pins) / Save as a new board "future jaunt" / Just keep as is

  two words that characterize everything we do: Empathy & Innovation. 

V. Save this board as a snapshot to be shared
