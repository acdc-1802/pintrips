Pintrips is a progressive web app that allows users to plan for and journal trips by dropping custom pins to mark places they would like to go and places that they've been on individual 'place boards'. These boards, rendered with a React binding of MapboxGl, are shareable and can have multiple collaborators and styles. The real-time collaboration is possible because of the use of Google's Cloud Firestore, which allows board components to listen for any changes and automatically update when they happen. The app also uses service workers to give offline functionality to users while traveling so they can journal even in remote locations. At any point in the trip, users can send their pinned and styled boards as an online postcard that uses app geolocation and GreenSock animation to stamp and send to family and friends!
