MVP - Our most Basic Working App

User Database - saves user email, password, username
User has to sign up/login
Add a new board button OR go to a previously created board OR go to a shared board
New User will go to a new board - ask permission to use location
Map with current location will render with a dot showing current location
User can input a title => form field
User can choose whether this board is “shareable”
User can select a location which will render that location on the board => 
After filling out search field with pre-rendered locations
Option => solid pin -> where user is right now
Option => hollow pin -> where you want to go (date and coordinates will be captured once pin is fulfilled)
		
There is a “use location” option => gps button - takes your current location and convert it into coordinates
Clicking on a pin
Option => “I’m here now” => pin goes from hollow to full => date, coordinates and pin createdBy are captured in the backend
Option => delete pin
 
	6) Sharing Option: user puts in someone else’s userName and can share the board with them
Other user gets a new notification that someone shared a board with them
First user who created the board and shares it is the only one to share the boards to others
All users can add/delete pins on the board
